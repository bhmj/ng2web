# Introduction

[`ng2web`](https://github.com/davep/ng2web) is one in a [long line of Norton
Guide tools I've written over the latest couple or so
decades](https://www.davep.org/norton-guides/). It is, in effect, a
replacement for [`w3ng`](https://github.com/davep/w3ng) and
[`ng2html`](https://github.com/davep/ng2html).

As for what it does: it will take a [Norton Guide
file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Guides) and turn the content into
a collection of HTML pages, which you can then incorporate into a web site.

# Usage

The command is called `ng2web` and all command line options can be found
with:

```sh
ng2web --help
```

giving output like this:

```bash exec="on" result="text"
ng2web --help
```
